Collision handling
 -Seperate chaining
    0| 5                           Node[] arr = new Node[5];   for creating this hash table
    1|
    2| 7 -> 2 -> 12
    3| 3 -> 8
    4|
 -Open adderessing
    -Linear Probing :-
       % -> used for range              dec -> Integer[] arr = new Integer[5]
        22 is my  no to stores
        22 % 5 =2   2nd index is not empty so
        (2+1) % 5 = 3        so we will keep it in 3rd index.
        0 1 2 3  4
        - - - 22 null
        
        in this case space is limited 
        Linear probing only checks the next slot sequentially. If many consecutive slots are full, it doesn’t spread out entries well compared to quadratic probing or double hashing.

    -Quadratic Probing :-
        instead of single jump it does sequential jumping.
        6 % 5 =1
        (1 + 1^2) % 5 = 2
        (1 + 2^2) % 5 = 3

    -Double Hashing :-
        do hasing again for the already generated hash code.

* HashCode() - function to generate hash code in java (always in integer) by the jvm and is unpredictable.
               depends on diff jvm versions as well.
               java.lang.object -> generates hashcode (head of all classes)
               ex -> (927679344) % 5 = 4
